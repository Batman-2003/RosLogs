## 1_spinning_in_Rviz
### Description : 
A Potentiometer is used as an analog input device to provide a change in angle , which is read by 
the arduino and then , arduino sends a transform back to host system using rosserial.

Then, Rviz is used to Visualize these transforms.

## 2_servo_control_gui
### Description :
Gui is made using tkinter(python2.7) , the inserted field data gets send to a transform publisher 
written in the same file on button press. 
The same message can be used to control real servo motor as demonstrated in Task no. 0.

## 4_collision_detection
### Description :
The MainScript is used to get some inputs and then run a couple of scripts , one for transfer of data to an excel file and the other is a roslaunch file.

The input is 2 points (Start and End), the height at which the plane is located ( relative to neutral horizontal position of arm ) , the shape of obstacle and it's location in XY plane.

The dimensions of obstacle are used to modify the "original.urdf" into "modified.urdf" which is then passed onto roslaunch.

The path is generated by another script ( ran by mainscript itself ) and this script also transfers data like points , dimensions,etc to excel file.

Then, it sends the path generated along with all the angles of joints to the excel file with it's status ( colliding or not )

### Build Instructions ( Python 2.7 and Ros-Melodic )
  1. Install openpyxl , numpy and other dependencies
  2. Copy the "collision_0" package into your ros workspace's src.
  3. Run `catkin_make` in your workspace
  4. cd into scripts sub-directory and then run mainscript.sh

### Further Improvements :
  -   [x] add color support to `dataTransfer.py`
  -   [ ] add cuboidal obstacle support
  -   [ ] add support for python3 in Noetic
  -   [ ] add support for non-rectilinear paths
